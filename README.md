# jump-start

A shortcut to my favorite code. Want your own? Check out
[kevinschaul/jump-start-template](https://github.com/kevinschaul/jump-start-template).

`jump-start` is a lightweight system to organize that code that
you keep coming back to. It's a structured GitHub repository,
a CLI tool, and a web frontend.

A **starter** is a directory of code that you like -- whether
it’s a single script or an entire app. Each starter lives in a
**group** directory. Organize similar code for easier
navigation.

When you want to use your favorite code, locate that starter
either in this README.md, in your gallery website, or by searching
with the CLI. Copy the command, and run it in your terminal.
Your starter code is now in your project.

node/**timestamp_if_changed**

```
jump-start use @kevinschaul/node/timestamp_if_changed
```

A script to help organize timestamped versions of a file. Useful when you download a file every so often but only want to save it if its contents have changed.

Given a file, make a copy of LATEST_FILE with the current timestamp appended to the filename if the file is different from the previous version. The previous version is the file in the directory of LATEST_FILE with the same prefix as LATEST_FILE that has the most recent timestamp in its filename.

e.g. "evacuations-latest.geojson" would become "evacuations-2025-01-08T12:03:01.geojson"

Usage: node timestamp_if_changed.js LATEST_FILE

---
node/**update_datawrapper_map**

```
jump-start use @kevinschaul/node/update_datawrapper_map

## Adding a starter

Why not use jump-start to add a starter? Run the following command, replacing
STARTER_GROUP with a group name (e.g. `react`), and STARTER_NAME with a
starter name (e.g. `BarChart`).

```
jump-start use @kevinschaul/jump-start-template/example/starter STARTER_GROUP/STARTER_NAME
```

Then, add your code, and edit the generated `jump-start.yaml` file to your liking.

### `jump-start.yaml`

Each starter must contain this file, which defines a few items used by the
gallery.

Some examples:

- [kevinschaul react-d3/LineChart](https://github.com/kevinschaul/jump-start/blob/main/react-d3/LineChart/jump-start.yaml)
- [kevinschaul r/data-analysis](https://github.com/kevinschaul/jump-start/blob/main/r/data-analysis/jump-start.yaml)

**`description`**: Anything you want to write about this starter. It could be
the code’s features, any additional installation instructions, whatever. This
appears in the `## Starters` section of the README.md, and in the web gallery.

**`defaultDir`**: Where the files generated by this starter will be placed by
default. For example, if you know that your React components live in
`components/elements/`, set the `defaultDir` to that. The jump-start command
shown in the README.md and gallery will place the files into this directory.

**`mainFile`** (optional): The file shown initially in the gallery's "Starter files
section.

**`preview`** (optional): Configuration that gets passed down to the gallery's
"Preview" section. The previews render via
[Sandpack](https://sandpack.codesandbox.io/docs/getting-started/usage), so this
configuration mimics Sandpack's. Currently only supports React. Your starter
must include the file `Preview.js`, which default exports a React component.

**`preview.template`** (optional, e.g. "react"): The template used by Sandpack.
I've only used "react" but others may work too.

**`preview.dependencies`** (optional, e.g. `d3: "5"`): An object containing
dependencies for Sandpack to use for the preview. Think of it as the
`package.json` file for the preview. Anything your starter needs should be
listed here.

## Customizing gallery-wide settings with `.env`

`jump-start` uses `.env` for a few settings:

- `GITHUB_USERNAME`: GitHub usename used in commands and links. This is set by
  default in the deploy GitHub action.
- `GITHUB_REPO`: GitHub repo name used in commands and links. This is set by
  default in the deploy GitHub action.

## Running the gallery locally

To run the gallery locally, using the starters in this repo as its data:

```
jump-start storybook dev --instance-path .
```

Open [localhost:6006](localhost:6006) in a browser.

## Deploying the gallery to Github Pages

This repo includes a [deploy workflow](.github/workflows/deploy.yml) that
deploys your jump start gallery to Github pages.
