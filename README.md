# jump-start-template

A shortcut to your favorite code.

`jump-start` is a lightweight system to organize that code that
you keep coming back to. It’s a structured GitHub repository
and a web frontend.

A **starter** is a directory of code that you like -- whether
it’s a single script or an entire app. Each starter lives in a
**group** directory. Organize similar code for easier
navigation.

When you want to use your favorite code, locate that starter
either in this README.md or in your gallery website. Copy the
command, and run it in your terminal. Your starter code is now
in your project.

## Adding a starter

Why not use jump-start to add a starter? Run the following command, replacing
STARTER_GROUP with a group name (e.g. `react`), and STARTER_NAME with a
starter name (e.g. `BarChart`).

    npx degit kevinschaul/jump-start-template/example/starter STARTER_GROUP/STARTER_NAME

Then, add your code, and edit the generated `jump-start.yaml` file to your liking.

## `jump-start.yaml`

Each starter must contain this file, which defines a few items used by the
gallery.

**`description`**: Anything you want to write about this starter. It could be
the code’s features, any additional installation instructions, whatever. This
appears in the `## Starters` section of the README.md, and in the web gallery.

**`defaultDir`**: Where the files generated by this starter will be placed by
default. For example, if you know that your React components live in
`components/elements/`, set the `defaultDir` to that. The jump-start command
shown in the README.md and gallery will place the files into this directory.
  
## How to use this template

1. At [GitHub](https://github.com/kevinschaul/jump-start-template), click "Use this template" -> "Create a new repository"
2. Give your repository a name. Might I suggest "jump-start"?
3. On the `main` branch, add your favorite code!

## Running the gallery locally

The jump-start gallery code lives in [a separate
repo](https://github.com/kevinschaul/jump-start-gallery),
included in this repo as a git submodule. To run the gallery
locally, using the starters in this repo as its data:

    npm run gallery:clone
    npm run gallery:install
    npm run gallery:dev

Open [localhost:3000](localhost:3000) in a browser.

## Updating the gallery code

The snapshot of the jump-start-gallery code in this repo will
inevitibly get outdated. To update it to the latest version:

    npm run gallery:update
