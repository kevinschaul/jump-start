  A script to help organize timestamped versions of a file. Useful when you download a file every so often but only want to save it if its contents have changed.

  Given a file, make a copy of LATEST_FILE with the current timestamp appended to the filename if the file is different from the previous version. The previous version is the file in the directory of LATEST_FILE with the same prefix as LATEST_FILE that has the most recent timestamp in its filename.

  e.g. "evacuations-latest.geojson" would become "evacuations-2025-01-08T12:03:01.geojson"

  Usage: node timestamp_if_changed.js LATEST_FILE
mainFile: timestamp_if_changed.js
